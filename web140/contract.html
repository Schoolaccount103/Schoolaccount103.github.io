    	<h2><b>Course Contract</b></h2>
    	<p>I, Lee Harris, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB140-N801 Web Development Tools Course with my instructor, Ella McManus.</p>
    	<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
    	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
    	<p>Signed: Lee Harris, 11 September 2024</p>
